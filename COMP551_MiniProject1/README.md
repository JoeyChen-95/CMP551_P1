In this project, we investigated the performance of two classification models, K-Nearest Neighbours
(KNN) and Decision Tree (DT), on predicting whether the individual will earn $50k/year and whether
a child should be sent to nursery. During the experiment, we found that DT had a higher accuracy of
prediction on the testing data than the KNN when we chose the hyperparameter of best performance
for them. We also discovered that DT was significantly faster than that of KNN. When we carried out
the experiment on how training size affects accuracy, we found that the relationships between them
are different in two datasets. Therefore, we concluded that accuracy does not have a clear relationship
with the size of the training data, it depends on choice of dataset.
