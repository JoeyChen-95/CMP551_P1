In this project, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify handwritten digits and letters on images from the combo MNIST dataset. We train the model based on the training dataset as well as the unlabelled dataset. Finally, by bagging several of our well-performed models, the highest accuracy we reached on the public test set on Kaggle is 96.450\%.
